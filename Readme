Basic template for building landing pages efficiently using SCSS and Gulp.

Note: 
A custom bootstrap setup with common components was used.
Replacing "css/bootstrap.min.css" with the Development version of bootstrap can be done.
Just run "gulp concat-css" for the changes to take effect

Usage:

Npm install the directory
Gulp the directory
Navigate to http://localhost:3000/
and Happy coding

After completion run
"gulp concat-css" and delete <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/styles.min.css"> from the index page.


Debug tools
"css/styles.css" is used for debugging the processed scss file located in "sass/styles.scss"
